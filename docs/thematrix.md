## Code

So sometimes we want to put `code` into our documents and directly have it goodly formated as we programmers can't read
not colored code.

### Kotlin

```kotlin
fun main() {
    println("Hello World")
}
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
console.log("Hello World")
```

### Java

```java 
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World")
    }
}
```

### Mermaid Diagrams

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
Alice->>John: Hello John, how are you?
John-->>Alice: Great!
Alice-)John: See you later!
```

and

```mermaid
erDiagram
    _customer_order {
    int A
    }
```

### Python

```python
print("Hello World")
```

Text that is _cursive_ __fat__ ___fat and cursive___. But also ~~strikethrough~~!
With that we can make the Text more readable.
