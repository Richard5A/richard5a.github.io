ðŸ‘‹. I'm Richard. On this page I will put some stuff I'm interested and probably also tutorials / step-by-step
instructions to do things... I mean, just knowledge I want to share with the world! Feel free to look at the sources
on [GitHub](https://github.com/Richard5A/richard5a.github.io/). Have fun!

## About me

I'm a person from Germany with a big love to Android and Kotlin because they both are open source. Windows is my
favorite operating system for computers because I'm obsessed of WinUI 3.

## New things

* A simple plugin system in Kotlin - [Read more](/learn/kotlin/simple-plugin-system)
* Me & Open Source - [Read more](/oss)
coming anytime.
