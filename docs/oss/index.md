# Me & Open Source

I'm a big fan of open source projects. Although I'm not contributing a lot, I think it's important to share all the
knowledge and code that is not necessary to keep private with the world.
Of course there are a lot of reasons to keep projects private:

- It's your freaking main business. (Photoshop, Windows, MS Office, ...)
- It's a project that is not ready to be shared. (Unfinished, buggy, ...)
- The code is so messy that you're ashamed of it.

As e.g. Microsoft has shown with the Windows Calculator, it's possible to share parts of your system (in this case
of Windows 11) with the world.

Here are some of [my favorite OSS projects](/examples-of-oss)

## Why is OSS so important?

### Inspiration

Often people are having the same problems. If you have closed source, everyone facing this problem will eventually
implement their own version of the same stuff. This is - in my opinion - a waste of time. If you have open source, you
can just look at the code and maybe even use it in your project.

### Contribution

Most OSS allow you to contribute to the project. This is great because you can help the project to grow and maybe even
get some experience in coding. Also, you can learn from the code of others. With that you help every user of the project
to get a better user experience.

### Free-ness

You can't make money with OSS. But it can - and eventually will - save people money.
